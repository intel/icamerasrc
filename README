        1. Setup environment
        2. Configure
        3. Build icamerasrc with Makefile
        4. Build and install icamerasrc RPM
        5. Running Gstreamer pipeline with icamerasrc

Setup environment
=============

    Prerequisite packages:
        Ubuntu 14.04
        glib-2.0
        gobject-2.0
        gstreamer-1.0(Version 1.7.9 is preferred)
        libcamhal
        autoconf
        libtool

Configure
=============

        autoreconf --install

        ./configure -I$libcamhal_dir/include -I$libcamhal_dir/include/api -I$libcamhal_dir/include/utils LDFLAGS=-L$libcamhal_dir/lib

Build icamerasrc with Makefile
=============

        make clean

        make -j

        sudo make install

Build and install icamerasrc RPM
=============

    This step is taken after building successed

    Build RPM:
        make rpm (RPM package is generated in rpm/)

    Install RPM:
        rpm -ivh icamerasrc-*.rpm
